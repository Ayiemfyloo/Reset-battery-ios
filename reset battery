RESET BATTERY HEALTH

•	⁠rm /var/containers/Shared/SystemGroup/*/Library/BatteryLife/CurrentPowerlogX(replace X with a star, I’m too dump to copy paste, this deletes the 3 files related to the battery overview, the 3 files are generated by iOS itself again)
•	⁠Then killall aggregated (battery logging daemon)

This doesn’t harm your device, it’s just what Purge95
